# For loop - is used to repeat a block of code for each item in a sequence
# when number of repetitions is fixed/known (example: print 1â€“10).

# Example: 

for i in range(5):                    # range(start, stop, step)  
    print(i)

Output => 0
          1
          2
          3
          4

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for f in fruits:                       # f => variable name for iterate
    print(f)

Output => apple
          banana
          cherry
